title: "HoloPhysics"


##Features

####R1. 


Avatar, objective, vectores

Being able to apply a vector

Have the avatar move thorough the environtment based on that vector

Decompose the applied vector into subcomponents

- x

- y 

- z

Tutorials

Menu station




####R2.

Put Barrier between avatar and objective.

Have a menu that toggles different vectors on or off (Displaying that is)

User can pause on the middle of the avatar moving and apply new vectors

Skinning the avatar  


####R3 




### Astronomy
- Visualization of Bending of space time
- Model for black holes 
- Sound for massive objects moving
- Animation of planets/stars/everything else
- Have section for quasars/wormholes
- Animation of supernovae
- Be able to show aspects of relativity (general and/or special)
- Rank 4: have achievements, specifically sending the avatar into orbit and use walls and other real world objects as obstacles
